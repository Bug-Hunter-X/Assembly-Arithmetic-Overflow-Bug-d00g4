```assembly
mov ax, 1000h ; Load a large value into AX
cmp bx, 0FFFFh - 1000h ; check for potential overflow 
je overflow_check  ; jump to overflow check
add ax, bx ; Add BX to AX
jmp end_check
overflow_check:
; handle overflow error here (e.g., set an error flag, halt the program etc. )
end_check:
```

This solution adds a comparison to check if adding BX to AX will cause an overflow. If there is a potential overflow, the program jumps to an overflow check section where you can implement the proper handling of the overflow error.  This solution prevents the potential for incorrect calculations caused by the overflow.
